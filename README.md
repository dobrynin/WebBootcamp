# WebBootcamp

## Tips
* Two main sites for Web knowledge: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  * MDN's content is typically of much higher quality (more modern and accurate). W3Schools is okay for a quick lookup, but for in-depth learning prefer MDN
* If you like learning interactively and have no experience w/ web technologies, the free course materials available at [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com) are decent
