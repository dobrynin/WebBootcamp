# WebBootcamp

## Tips
* Two main sites for Web knowledge: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  * MDN's content is typically of much higher quality (more modern and accurate). W3Schools is okay for a quick lookup, but for in-depth learning prefer MDN
* If you like learning interactively and have no experience w/ web technologies, the free course materials available at [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com) are decent
* If you like learning with a book, this one is a decent reference: [HTML + CSS](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1XQRJJCXNBMJ9&keywords=html+css&qid=1572580806&sprefix=html+c%2Caps%2C237&sr=8-4)
